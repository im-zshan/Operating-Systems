# Operating Systems
An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.

This repository will contain the project codes/system calls based on Assembly Language and xv6.

* System Calls - A system call is a method for a computer program to request a service from the kernel of the operating system on which it is running.
* XV6 - A much more functional OS that we can absorb its essence by tracing code.
